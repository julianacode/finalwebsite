	<h1>About the Dandelion</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Dandelion is believed to be a deity of Life (and, subsequently, Death) that can be found in any sandy desert by any honest traveller in need of aid and rest. </p>
	<p>Dandelion and their Oasis have been recorded in multiple parts of the world - references are argued to be found in Homer's epics, Imru' al-Qais' poems, and even Mesoamerican art. Some believe that Mansa Musa's wife swam in the Oasis during their historic Mecca.</p>
	<p>Due to what is believed to be an EMP field around the Oasis, photography of the Oasis is impossible. This is why its existence was widely disbelieved until the 19th century, even though its presence can be found in even Marco Polo's texts. Even to this day, an estimated 78% of Americans are sceptical of its existence, and 12% believe it is a made up conspiracy of a folktale gone out-of-hand. </p>
	<p>To try and prove the existence of this being and its home, many willingly put themselves in dangerous situations in the desert to encourage the Oasis to appear. However, Dandelion only responds to honest travellers - meaning that anyone who looks for the Oasis with greedy intentions, like making a profit off of "proving" the existence of the Oasis, will not see the Oasis. While this protects the Oasis, it also results in no skilled artists being able to access and inevitably recreate an accurate version of the Oasis. As a result, the only composites of Dandelion and their Oasis are poorly executed, which only adds to the universal disbelief of the deity's existence.</p>
