<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<br>
	<p><b>Why Does Dandelion's Oasis Change Locations?</b></p>
	<p>This is a misconception - Dandelion's location does not change, it exists exactly where it's always existed, regardless of the desert that we enter it through.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Does Dandelion Have Legal Permission for The Oasis?</b></p>

	<p>Dandelion doesn't care about man-made borders and territories, and whether the act of moving location is intentional to assert this lack of care or if Dandelion doesn't care enough for it to be even moderately intentional is unknown. </p>

	<p><b>Does Dandelion have powers?</b></p>
	<p>This is tricky, as it is highly controversial whether or not Dandelion even speaks. This is because some have reported Dandelion explaining that they are a Deity with the powers of Life and Death, however the vast majority of accounts describe Dandelion as silent and aloof. It has been observed by many, however, Dandelion making plants bear fruit, implying the existence of that least the power of Life. Of course, there is some ability to manipulate spacetime to actually move the Oasis.</p>
